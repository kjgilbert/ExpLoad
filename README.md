# Expansion Load Simulation Code

C++ code modified from [Peischl & Excoffier 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.13154/abstract). If you use this code, please cite [Gilbert *et al. In prep.*]().

Simulates either a 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional landscape of discrete demes in a stepping stone or lattice model, respectively. Landscape is of zie m1 $x$ m2. An initial number of demes (starting_demes) is colonized with individuals from an ancestral, panmictic population of size anc_pop_size.
